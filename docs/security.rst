.. _the security of pyarmor:

The Security of PyArmor
=======================

|PyArmor| will obfuscate python module in two levels. First obfucate
each function in module, then obfuscate the whole module file. For
example, there is a file `foo.py`::

  def hello():
      print('Hello world!')

  def sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  if __name == '__main__':
      hello()
      print('1 + 1 = %d' % sum(1, 1))

|PyArmor| first obfuscates the function `hello` and `sum`, then
obfuscates the whole moudle `foo`. In the runtime, only current called
function is restored and it will be obfuscated as soon as code object
completed execution. So even trace code in any ``c`` debugger, only a
piece of code object could be got one time.

.. _protect dynamic library _pytransform:

Cross Protection for `_pytransform`
-----------------------------------

The core functions of |PyArmor| are written by `c` in the dynamic
library `_pytransform`. `_pytransform` protects itself by JIT
technical, and the obfuscated scripts is protected by `_pytransform`.
On the other hand, the dynamic library `_pytransform` is checked in
the obfuscated script to be sure it's not changed. This is called
Cross Protection.

The dynamic library `_pytransform.so` uses JIT technical to achieve
two tasks:

* Keep the des key used to encrypt python scripts from tracing by any
  c debugger
* The code segment can't be changed any more. For example, change
  instruction `JZ` to `JNZ`, so that `_pytransform.so` can execute
  even if checking license failed

How JIT works?

First PyArmor defines an instruction set based on GNU lightning.

Then write some core functions by this instruction set in c file, maybe like this::

    t_instruction protect_set_key_iv = {
        // function 1
        0x80001,
        0x50020,
        ...

        // function 2
        0x80001,
        0xA0F80,
        ...
    }

    t_instruction protect_decrypt_buffer = {
        // function 1
        0x80021,
        0x52029,
        ...

        // function 2
        0x80001,
        0xC0901,
        ...
    }

Build `_pytransform.so`, calculate the codesum of code segment of
`_pytransform.so`

Replace the related instructions with real codesum got before, and
obfuscate all the instructions except "function 1" in c file. The
updated file maybe likes this::

    t_instruction protect_set_key_iv = {
        // plain function 1
        0x80001,
        0x50020,
        ...

        // obfuscated function 2
        0xXXXXX,
        0xXXXXX,
        ...
    }

    t_instruction protect_decrypt_buffer = {
        // plain function 1
        0x80021,
        0x52029,
        ...

        // obfuscated function 2
        0xXXXXX,
        0xXXXXX,
        ...
    }

Finally build `_pytransform.so` with this changed c file.

When running obfuscated script, `_pytransform.so` loaded. Once a
protected function is called, it will

1. Generate code from `function 1`
2. Run `function 1`:
    * check codesum of code segment, if not expected, quit
    * check tickcount, if too long, quit
    * check there is any debugger, if found, quit
    * clear hardware breakpoints if possible
    * restore next function `function 2`
3. Generate code from `function 2`
4. Run `function 2`, do same thing as `function 1`

After repeat some times, the real code is called. All of that is to be
sure there is no breakpoint in protection code.

In order to protect `_pytransform` in Python script, some extra code
will be inserted into the entry script, refer to :ref:`Special
Handling of Entry Script`

The security of different feature number
----------------------------------------

There may be several dynamic libraries with different features in each
platform. The platform name with feature number suffix combines an unique
name. For example, `linux.x86_64.21` has feature `21`, and `windows.x86.0` has
feature `0`. The security of each feature is different.

The library with feature `21` and `25` has been protected by strong vm tool and
many anti-debug technicals, it's safe.

Feature `0` means no any protection, so it's better to protect it by any third
tool.

For all the other features, they're protected by a simple vm and some anti-debug
technicals, it's not strong enough, it's also recommend to protect them by any third tool.

Changing core algorithm from time to time
-----------------------------------------

PyArmor may change the core algorithm from time to time, so the obfuscated
scripts are obfuscated by new version may be totaly different from the prior
ones.

.. unused:

    If you want to hide the code more thoroughly, try to use any other
    tool such as ASProtect_, VMProtect_ to protect dynamic library
    `_pytransform` which is distributed with obfuscated scripts.
