Using PyArmor
=============

The syntax of the ``pyarmor`` command is:

    ``pyarmor`` [*command*] [*options*]

Obfuscating Python Scripts
--------------------------

Use command :ref:`obfuscate` to obfuscate python scripts. In the most simple
case, set the current directory to the location of your program ``myscript.py``
and execute::

    pyarmor obfuscate myscript.py

|PyArmor| obfuscates :file:`myscript.py` and all the :file:`*.py` in the same folder:

* Create :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder if it doesn't exists.
* Creates a folder :file:`dist` in the same folder as the script if it does not exist.
* Writes the obfuscated :file:`myscript.py` in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Writes all the obfuscated :file:`*.py` in the same folder as the script in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Copy runtime files used to run obfuscated scripts to the :file:`dist` folder.

In the :file:`dist` folder the obfuscated scripts and all the required files are
generated::

    dist/
        myscript.py

        pytransform/
            __init__.py
            _pytransform.so/.dll/.dylib

The extra folder ``pytransform`` called :ref:`Runtime Package`, it's required to
run the obfuscated script.

Normally you name one script on the command line. It's entry script. The content
of :file:`myscript.py` would be like this::

    from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime
    pyarmor_runtime()
    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x06\x0f...')

The first 2 lines called :ref:`Bootstrap Code`, are only in the entry
script. They must be run before using any obfuscated file. For all the other
obfuscated :file:`*.py`, there is only last line::

    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x0a\x02...')

Run the obfuscated script::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

By default, only the :file:`*.py` in the same path as the entry script are
obfuscated. To obfuscate all the :file:`*.py` in the sub-folder recursively,
execute this command::

    pyarmor obfuscate --recursive myscript.py

Distributing Obfuscated Scripts
-------------------------------

Just copy all the files in the output path `dist` to end users. Note that except
the obfuscated scripts, the :ref:`Runtime Package` need to be distributed to end
users too.

PyArmor only deals with `.py` files, if there are data files or binary extension
in the package, copy them to ``dist`` manually.

The :ref:`Runtime Package` may not with the obfuscated scripts, it could be
moved to any Python path, only if `import pytransform` works.

About the security of obfuscated scripts, refer to :ref:`The Security of PyArmor`

.. note::

   PyArmor need NOT be installed in the runtime machine


Generating License For Obfuscated Scripts
-----------------------------------------

Use command :ref:`licenses` to generate new :file:`license.lic` for obfuscated
scripts.

Generate an expired license for obfuscated script::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 r001

|PyArmor| generates new license file:

* Read data from :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic` in the ``licenses/r001`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic.txt` in the ``licenses/r001`` folder

Obfuscate the scripts with this new one::

    pyarmor obfuscate --with-license licenses/r001/license.lic myscript.py

Now run obfuscated script, It will report error after Jan. 1, 2019::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

Generate license to bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine, first get hardware
information::

    pyarmor hdinfo

Then generate new license bind to harddisk serial number and mac address::

    pyarmor licenses --bind-disk "100304PBN2081SF3NJ5T" --bind-mac "20:c1:d2:2f:a0:96" code-002

Run obfuscated script with new license::

    pyarmor obfuscate --with-license licenses/code-002/license.lic myscript.py

    cd dist/
    python myscript.py

It also could be use an outer license file `license.lic` with the obfuscated
scripts. By outer license, just obfuscate scripts once, then generate new
license to overwrite the old license on demand. This is the tradional way, refer
to :ref:`How to use outer license file`

Extending License Type
----------------------

It's easy to extend any other licese type for obfuscated scripts: **just add
authentication code in the entry script**. The script can't be changed any more
after it is obfuscated, so do whatever you want in your script. In this case the
:ref:`module pytransform` would be useful.

The prefer way is :ref:`using plugin to extend license type`. The advantage is
that your scripts needn't be changed at all. Just write authentication code in a
separated script, and inject it in the obfuscated scripts as obfuscating. For
more information, refer to :ref:`How to Deal with Plugins`

Here are some plugin examples

https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/tree/master/plugins

Obfuscating Single Module
-------------------------

To obfuscate one module exactly, use option ``--exact``::

    pyarmor obfuscate --exact foo.py

Only :file:`foo.py` is obfuscated, now import this obfuscated module::

    cd dist
    python -c "import foo"

Obfuscating Whole Package
-------------------------

Run the following command to obfuscate a package::

    pyarmor obfuscate --recursive --output dist/mypkg mykpg/__init__.py

To import the obfuscated package::

    cd dist
    python -c "import mypkg"

Packing Obfuscated Scripts
--------------------------

Use command ``pack`` to pack obfuscated scripts into the bundle.

First install `PyInstaller`::

    pip install pyinstaller

Set the current directory to the location of your program
``myscript.py`` and execute::

    pyarmor pack myscript.py

|PyArmor| packs :file:`myscript.py`:

* Execute ``pyarmor obfuscate`` to obfuscate :file:`myscript.py`
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscipt.py`` to create :file:`myscript.spec`
* Update :file:`myscript.spec`, replace original scripts with obfuscated ones
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscript.spec`` to  bundle the obfuscated scripts

In the ``dist/myscript`` folder you find the bundled app you distribute to your
users.

Run the final executeable file::

    dist/myscript/myscript

Generate an expired license for the bundle::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 code-003
    pyarmor pack --with-license licenses/code-003/license.lic myscript.py

    dist/myscript/myscript

For complicated cases, refer to command :ref:`pack` and :ref:`How to pack obfuscated scripts`.

Improving Security Further
--------------------------

These `PyArmor`_ features could import security further:

1. :ref:`Using super mode` to obufscate scripts if possible, otherwise enable
   :ref:`Advanced Mode` if the platform is supported. In Windows and the
   performance meets the requirement, enable :ref:`VM Mode`
2. Try to :ref:`binding obfuscated scripts to Python interpreter` if they're
   distributed as one executable bundle.
3. Make sure the entry script is patched by `cross protection code
   <https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-do.html#special-handling-of-entry-script>`_,
   and try to :ref:`Customizing cross protection code`
4. Use the corresponding :ref:`Restrict Mode` to make sure no one can import the
   obfuscated module.
5. Use the high security code obfuscation `--obf-code=2`
6. :ref:`Using plugin to improve security` by injecting your private checkpoints
   in the obfuscated scripts, there is one decorator :ref:`assert_armored` and
   one function :ref:`check_armored` in the :module:`pytransfrom` used to
   prevent monkey trick hacking. You can also add any other check points to make
   sure the obfuscated scripts are not hacked.
7. If data files need to be protected, refer to :ref:`How to protect data files`
